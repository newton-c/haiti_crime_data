    <h1>The Human Costs of the Crisis in Haiti</h1>
    <p>The most common way we measure crime is homicides. Killing is often
        caused by competition between criminal groups; it is used to coerce and intimidate
        civilians, and is easier to measure than crimes such as kidnapping
        or trafficking.
    </p>
    <p>Since the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in July 2021,
       homicides have spiked as criminal groups fill the void left
       by a shattered government.
    </p>
    <img src="figs/homicides.png" style="width:600px;height:450px">
    <p>The violence is being driven by gangs fighting for territory and trying
      to intimidate civilians into cooperating. Much of the violence is concetrated in areas
      such as the Port-au-Prince suburb, Cité Soleil
    </p>
    <iframe src="figs/m.html" style="width:640px; height:450px"></iframe>
    <p>But homicides only tell part of the
        suffering caused by Haiti's criminal take over. Kidnappings have
        surged, according to data by the UNODC.

     <p>While most countries in the region
        saw fewer people internally displaced last year, Haiti had a 
        massive increase.
     </p>
     <img src="figs/idp_circles.png" style="width:600px;height:450px">
     <p>The 430% increase in internally displanced people due to conflict in Haiti from 2021
     to 2022 is the largest increase the region has witnessed since
     data started being collected in 2018. With 106,000 people
     displace in 2022, Haiti saw more displacements that larger
     countries with potent criminal groups, such as Brazil and Mexico, have experienced in recent
     years.</p>
     <img src="figs/idps.png" style="width:600px;height:450px">
     <p>The situation in Haiti has exacerbated
    hunger initially caused by poverty and natural disaster. An
    Integrated Food Security Phase Classification analysis estimates
    that 1,807,955 Haitians are experiencing emergency levels of hunger. This
    situation is most dire in areas like Cité Solei, which has 
    become a <a href=https://insightcrime.org/news/g9-gpep-two-gang-alliances-tearing-haiti-apart>battleground for gangs</a>.
    </p>

    <p>And despite going three years without
        a case of cholera, cases began surging again last year. The World
        Health Organization estimates that there has since been almost 60,000
        cases of the disease which is nearly absent from the rest of Latin America
        and the Caribbean.
